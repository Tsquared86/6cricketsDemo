Hello and thank you for considering this. I tried to keep it simple and didnt make an additional component to be loaded into the component. I did make a service. but only for the timer

Since I was not given an endpoint API I created a dummy request and just hardcoded the secondsLeft value on the app component. There are few similar comments on the page to verify my train of thought.

I did a few assumptions for your second request as well, and they are included in function. Your initial note made me laugh because as a full stack develoepr with a mechatronics degree, all of that is very plausible.
